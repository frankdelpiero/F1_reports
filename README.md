Hello, I am Franccy del Piero Sambrano Ganoza, a computer engineer passionated with Formula 1 and data science and that with this project I combine both things that I like. In this season, I purpose myself to collect the data recorded in each session and showing into my notebooks using Fast F1 and Open F1 as API to analyze what happened in each session and predict what will happen in the qualyfing and the race. Also, I will show the data in qualy and race to see how I approached with the Free Practice data compared with qualy and race sessions. All information is available in the PDF notebooks folder.
